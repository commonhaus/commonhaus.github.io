What began as a personal project quickly grew beyond my initial expectations, gaining widespread adoption across various JVM communities. As our project expanded, it became clear that continuing independently was not sustainable. However, finding a foundation that allowed us to maintain our freedom and autonomy proved challenging.\r\nThat changed when I discovered the Commonhaus Foundation. They offer governance and oversight without stifling innovation with unnecessary processes and control. This makes them an ideal fit for SDKMAN. By joining the Commonhaus Foundation, we align ourselves with numerous other projects that benefit from their supportive environment. This partnership will bring the accountability, support, and oversight we need to ensure SDKMAN's continued growth and success.\"\r\n\r\n#### [EasyMock](https://easymock.org/) & [Objenesis](https://objenesis.org/)\r\n\r\n[Henri Tremblay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henritremblay/), current lead developer and co-creator of both frameworks, is happy to see these two projects safe at Commonhaus: ‚ÄúProjects like these two are widely used and having a foundation to shelter them and keep them alive is great news. Most foundations were not a good fit for just stable and long-lasting projects that want to keep their autonomy. Commonhaus arrives at the right time to fill that gap. From a personal perspective, I am honored to sit aside great open-source leaders who are members of the foundation. Many of them have given a lot of their free time to build the world we currently live in. I hope this will be recognized one day.‚Äù\r\n\r\n#### [Feign](https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign)\r\n\r\n[Marvin Froeder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marvin-froeder-96b8439), Feign's current maintainer commented: \"My involvement with Feign started quite by accident. I began using it for work and found myself needing additional features. Thanks to Feign's modular nature, I was able to easily write a number of extensions. Later on, the original developers reached out to me for help in maintaining the project, and I volunteered. Over time, they entrusted me with more and more responsibilities, eventually handing over the reins as they moved on to new ventures. Nowadays, I focus on bringing more contributors into Feign to ensure the project remains active and thriving.\r\n \r\nFeign chose the Commonhaus Foundation (CF) to address critical issues such as the project's truck factor, which currently stands at 2. Under the umbrella of CF, Feign is more likely to endure beyond the involvement of its current key contributors. The foundation provides a stable platform that encourages collaboration, version control, and effective project management. This partnership will help Feign leverage CF's resources, enhancing its development process and attracting a broader community of developers. By being part of a larger team within CF, Feign can ensure long-term sustainability, improve code quality, and benefit from increased visibility and community engagement.\"\r\n\r\n### About Commonhaus Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Commonhaus Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to the long-term sustainability of open source projects. By providing a neutral home, developer-led governance, and fiscal sponsorship, the foundation ensures that essential libraries and frameworks continue to advance, remaining accessible for future generations of developers and businesses across the spectrum.\r\n\r\n",
