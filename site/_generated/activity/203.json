When that is the case, that vote also does count when tallying quorum.\r\n\r\nIn some sense, it then is up to the project who is the primary and who is the secondary depending on time commitments, etc. Both would have access to egc discussions and lists.\r\n\r\nAnything I missed?\r\n\r\n### Voting group\r\n\r\n@commonhaus/cf-egc\r\n\r\n### Consensus mechanism\r\n\r\nPlease use emoji reactions to indicate your support:\r\n- **üëç (:+1:)** if it looks good to you\r\n- **üëÄ (:eyes:)** if you're \"ok\" with it (it may not be your favorite)\r\n- **üëé (:-1:)** if you think this needs discussion first\r\n\r\nAsk questions or raise concerns in comments.\r\n\r\n",
