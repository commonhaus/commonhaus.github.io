  "content": "We've introduced a bot to automate parts of our voting process.\r\n\r\nHere's how it simplifies our decision-making:\r\n\r\n- **Targeted Voting:** It counts votes specifically from different groups within our organization like the cf-council, egc, founders, or general members.\r\n\r\n- **Flexible Voting Criteria:** It supports various voting methods, including Martha's rules (approve, okay, revise), unique comments, or any type of reaction.\r\n\r\nHow this works (item == PR or discussion):\r\n\r\n1. When an item is tagged with `vote/open`, the posts a summary comment and adds a link to this summary at the top of the discussion/PR description. This link also includes a visual indicator of the voting status.\r\n2. The bot will periodically check the reactions (or count comments) on open items with the `vote/open` label, and will update its comment with the current status (how many votes in total, how many from the target/required group).\r\n4. When the comment is updated, a GH Action sends a notification to the website repository, which will regenerate the related results page and status indicator. \r\n\r\nThe bot already sends emails to the announce list when labels (`notice`, `vote/open`) are added to items.\r\n\r\nWe're still fine-tuning the process for concluding a vote, but the counting mechanism is excellent.\r\n\r\nSee it in action here: \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation-draft/discussions/95 -- The `vote/quorum` label was added by bot, as everyone in the `founders` group responded (thank you!). A status indicator link was also added to the top of the description.\r\n- You can also have a look at the [**unstyled** results page](https://www.commonhaus.org/votes/commonhaus/foundation-draft/95.html).\r\n\r\nUpdates to the website look and feel are coming soon. ;)"
