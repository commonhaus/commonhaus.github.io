That allowed me to explain once, but reference that explanation next to every mark to which it applied.\r\n\r\nvoting group: @commonhaus/cf-egc \r\n\r\nWhat to do: \r\n- If you like it or it looks good to you:\r\n    - Approve the PR\r\n    - **üëç (:+1:)** if it looks good to you\r\n    - **üëÄ (:eyes:)** if you're \"ok\" with it (it may not be your favorite)\r\n- If you think it needs discussion or revision\r\n    - Create a review, add your comments and require changes\r\n    - Use the +- button to make a suggestion (instead of just adding a comment).
