  "content": "### Announcement\r\n\r\nWe're truly overwhelmed by the positive response and support from all of you—it's clear we're filling a much-needed gap in the open-source ecosystem, and your enthusiastic feedback has confirmed just that. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who’s shown their support and enthusiasm for what we’re building together.\r\n\r\n## Why Sponsor?\r\n\r\nAs we gear up to expand and solidify our operations, we're inviting everyone in our community to consider a small sponsorship—just $1 per month or $8 per year.\r\n\r\nWhy ask for this commitment? It's straightforward: We aim to maintain our independence and steer clear of relying solely on vendor support. Each sponsorship represents more than just a donation; it's a powerful affirmation, a way of saying, \"I'm in!\" \r\n\r\nThis support is crucial for covering our minimal operating expenses and allowing us to remain driven by the community, for the community.\r\n\r\n### How We Use the Funds\r\n\r\nTo ensure transparency, we manage our funds through OpenCollective. Here’s a breakdown of our current expenses:\r\n\r\n- **General Infrastructure**: We cover ongoing expenses for Google Workspace, which serves as our hub for durable resource storage and foundation mailing lists.     We also maintain a subscription to [forwardemail.net](https://forwardemail.net/) for our `*@commonhaus.dev` addresses and fund a VPS that handles our automation and bots.\r\n- **Legal Assistance**: Aaron Williamson at [Williamson Legal](https://www.williamson.legal/) is helping us finalize our policies and procedures. Up next are our privacy policies and official project onboarding/fiscal hosting agreements.\r\n\r\n## Members, Members, Members\r\n\r\nOur primary focus is on expanding [project membership](https://www.commonhaus.org/bylaws/cf-membership.html). We plan to add two additional members to the Council, and we want these new representatives to be elected by our community.\r\n\r\nIf you're already a sponsor, please consider taking the extra step to become a member. Membership is opt-in, and we sincerely hope you'll join us.\r\n\r\n## Looking Ahead\r\n\r\nOur ambitions don't stop here. We're actively seeking larger corporate sponsors and will soon establish sponsorship tiers on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/commonhaus-foundation). These contributions will help us cover more than just daily expenses—they'll support trademark costs for projects that require them and will allow us to pursue other avenues for increased participation and engagements, like bug bounties, apprenticeships, or subsidized travel for project-centric meetups.\r\n\r\nWe're just getting started, and with your continued support, Commonhaus can become a sustainable and essential part of the open-source landscape.\r\n\r\nThank you once again for an outstanding launch week. Here’s to many more milestones and successes as a community!\r\n\r\n🙏 🥰 🚀\r\n\r\n",
