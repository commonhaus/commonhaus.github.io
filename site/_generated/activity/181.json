  "content": "I'm working on the draft fiscal hosting policy (yes, I will share it soon). There are a few loose ends I'm trying to tie up to simplify the reviewing process, and one of those areas is establishing clarity around what the foundation needs to own. \r\n\r\n**Trademarks** are the most obvious, and we've talked about those and have decent policies around those (Trademark and IP), both of which are pending final approval.\r\n\r\n**Domains** are the next most obvious, though we don't have that crisply written down as a policy yet. What I intend is for the foundation to own the domain while delegating access for domain management to project members\r\n\r\n**Email:** The foundation can provide email support as a foundation benefit. \r\n\r\n- Other email-related subscription services would have to be discussed. Monthly incurred cost for a single project would have to be offset by recurring revenue in the project's restricted fund, I think or you put the foundation/other projects at risk. \r\n\r\n- Mailing lists are a question. We have a google workspace, and I believe can do some things related to subdomain aliasing. Knowing what folks use vs. what they need going forward would be a good thing, and if anyone else is interesting in scouring Google Workspace docs to figure out what other cool things we can do there, that would be lovely.\r\n\r\n**Source Code:** Is it always a GitHub (or gitlab, ...) organization (with an administrative application installed and clear sponsorship relationship established between GH Organization and the Foundation)?\r\n\r\n- Doing it this way would imply all repositories within that organization are also owned by the Commonhaus Foundation and subject to its policies (which then delegate decision-making and some policy choices to the project)\r\n\r\n- If it is not an entire GH organization, and is instead a single repository, how do you indicate that transfer? Do we move those single repositories into a common parent? (commonhaus-projects) with teams allocated to manage each?\r\n\r\nI have more questions here than answers. ;)\r\n\r\nAlso, see #166 (Cloud accounts) and #167 (sponsorships)\r\n"
