At the moment (as written) our electronic participation threshold (quorum) is everyone. Not sure how that will scale as we add more projects. \r\n\r\nI think Gavin also noticed that it wasn't necessarily clear if procedures were the same or different for bylaws vs. policies. \r\n\r\nvoting group: @commonhaus/cf-egc\r\n\r\nDo one of the following:  \r\n\r\n- Approve the PR or react with **üëç (:+1:)** if it looks good to you\r\n- Review with Comments or react with **üëÄ (:eyes:)** if you're \"ok\" with it (it may not be your favorite)\r\n- If you think it needs discussion or revision\r\n    - Create a review, add your comments and require changes\r\n    - Use the +- button to make a suggestion (instead of just adding a comment). \r\n",
