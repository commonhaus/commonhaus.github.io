I have no great ideas for titles today. Suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Naming an officer is a council decision, but input from all is appreciated. \r\n- Conversation about the whys and hows of TCK certification should remain with #273 \n\n### Voting group\n\n@commonhaus/cf-council\n\n### Consensus mechanism\n\nPlease use emoji reactions to indicate your support:\r\n- **üëç (:+1:)** if it looks good to you\r\n- **üëÄ (:eyes:)** if you're \"ok\" with it (it may not be your favorite)\r\n- **üëé (:-1:)** if you think this needs discussion first\r\n\r\nAsk questions or raise concerns in comments.\r\n\n\n### Vote counting instructions\n\nMarthas "
