Unlike traditional storage solutions, SlateDB eliminates the need for local disks by writing directly to object storage like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. Its features include snapshot isolation, transactional writes, pluggable compaction, and in-memory read caching, making it an excellent fit for modern, distributed workloads.\r\n\r\nDesigned with simplicity and performance in mind, SlateDB supports use cases like durable execution, serverless workflows, and stream processing. With its lightweight, zero-disk architecture, SlateDB ensures reliability and efficiency for developers building cloud-native applications.\r\n\r\nChris Riccomini, current lead of SlateDB, wrote down his thoughts regarding this new development for the project:\r\n\r\nWe are thrilled to announce that [SlateDB](https://slatedb.io/) is now a proud member of [Commonhaus](https://www.commonhaus.org/), a trusted home for open-source projects. This partnership reinforces SlateDB's commitment to fostering innovation, openness, and long-term sustainability for our project and the wider community.\r\n\r\n**Why Commonhaus?** SlateDB has contributors from many different organizations, each with its own interests. Commonhaus provides a sustainable, flexible, neutral platform for open-source projects to thrive, ensuring that projects like SlateDB remain accessible, reliable, and community-focused.\r\n\r\n**What's Next?** Joining Commonhaus marks an exciting new chapter for SlateDB. With the support of Commonhaus and our growing community, we will focus on implementing new features like snapshot isolation and transactional writes, expanding our documentation, and ensuring SlateDB is the best solution for embedded, cloud-based storage.\r\n\r\nWe are incredibly grateful to our contributors and users for supporting SlateDB's journey so far. If youâ€™re interested in learning more, contributing, or exploring SlateDB, visit our [website](https://slatedb.io/) or check out the [Github repository](https://github.com/slatedb/slatedb).\r\n\r\nTogether, letâ€™s continue to build the future of cloud-native storage!\r\n\r\nChris Riccomini is an engineer, author, and investor. He currently runs Materialized View Capital and writes Materialized View, a weekly infrastructure newsletter.\r\n\r\n### Debezium\r\n[Debezium](https://debezium.io/) is the leading open-source platform for Change Data Capture. Since its inception in 2015, the project has seen exceptional growth and adoption, with a vibrant and highly active community of users across various industries. \r\n\r\nChris Cranford, a senior engineer working on Debezium, shared the following insights:\r\n\r\nOver the last several years, the CDC landscape has grown. There are significantly more data streaming providers than when Debezium started, and we believe that to provide CDC solutions for tomorrow, a path and goal must exist to invite and welcome developers, vendors, and providers into the conversation. Embracing an open foundation like Commonhaus will highlight our continued commitment to open-source, drive this conversation, and provide that path for others to participate.\r\n\r\nWe chose to join [the Commonhaus Foundation](https://debezium.io/blog/2024/11/04/debezium-moving-to-commonhaus/) because it provides an innovative approach to project governance. It continues to allow projects like Debezium to remain independent and make improvements and enhancements for all stakeholders, including its community. Debezium has long been a self-governing project. This philosophy has served the project well, and we also liked the idea that Commonhaus shares that vision.\r\n\r\nThe Debezium community is one of the critical backbones of the projectâ€™s success. This is a community not only of users but also of contributors, vendors, and streaming partners. This move is about each of you just as much as the projectâ€™s long-term success. We encourage anyone not yet involved to do so and help make Debezium even better!\r\n\r\nChris Cranford is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat and an active contributor and maintainer of Debezium, the industry-leading open-source platform for Change Data Capture (CDC). He enjoys contributing to open-source projects and sharing his insights through community engagements and conferences. He has nearly three decades of experience with relational databases, data management, and distributed systems integration.\r\n\r\n### About Commonhaus Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Commonhaus Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to the long-term sustainability of open source projects. By providing a neutral home, developer-led governance, and fiscal sponsorship, the foundation ensures that essential libraries and frameworks continue to advance, remaining accessible for future generations of developers and businesses across the spectrum.\r\n\r\n",
