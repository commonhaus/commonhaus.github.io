Ashni helped set up our initial structure while at MongoDB. She has moved on from that role, and I would love to have her help with vendor outreach in 2025.\n\n### Voting group\n\n@commonhaus/cf-council\n\n### Consensus mechanism\n\nPlease use emoji reactions to indicate your support:\r\n- **👍 (:+1:)** if it looks good to you\r\n- **👀 (:eyes:)** if you're \"ok\" with it (it may not be your favorite)\r\n- **👎 (:-1:)** if you think this needs discussion first\r\n\r\nAsk questions or raise concerns in comments.\r\n\n\n### Vote counting instructions\n\nMarthas ",
