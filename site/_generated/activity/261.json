  "content": "I am playing with how to automate gathering data to support a project health dashboard.\r\n\r\nHere are some ideas: \r\n\r\n- Data can be augmented with information in the private project repository\r\n- Raw statistics collected in the private project repository (JSON)\r\n- Rendered dashboards with aggregated data + signatory comments could be rendered as markdown + mermaid in GitHub and optionally on the website (foundation repository)\r\n\r\nI would like some other opinions on information that is useful (or not) to include.\r\n\r\n- Some information requires tending (like # of committers). \r\n- Some information does not currently have a great API to fetch (download statistics from Maven, though there may be better ways to do this with upgraded tools).\r\n\r\nAny other thoughts/ideas?"
