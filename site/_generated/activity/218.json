  "content": "This PR serves as the formal withdrawal of OpenRewrite from Commonhaus in the bootstrapping period. When OpenRewrite first joined early on, much of what is now proposed as the formal structure of the foundation was not yet developed. We have used these last months to observe the structure as it formed, offer input along the way, and challenge the proposed structure in ways that would allow OpenRewrite to continue to be part of the foundation after the bootstrapping period ended. **We still believe in the future of Commonhaus** and the value it adds to projects and their community, but the bootstrapping period has revealed to us some differences in directional vision that we feel are unresolvable.\r\n\r\nI don't believe this PR needs approval from a group, since I am the ECG representative of the project in the bootstrapping period prior to everything being formalized.\r\n\r\nI'll try to summarize what we have learned, in the spirit of being helpful to others:\r\n\r\n## Commonhaus is not as confederate as we imagined, and that’s OK\r\n\r\nWhen OpenRewrite originally joined, what we imagined was really twofold: (1) a depository for the trademark and (2) for every other administrative aspect of the project an opt-in structure that delegated to the project as much administration as the project was willing to perform on its own.\r\n\r\nFor (1) the goal was to provide some assurance that OpenRewrite core would continue to be fully open source (a commitment Moderne still holds to).\r\n\r\nFor (2) we imagined a foundation that consisted of projects with varying degrees of legal and administrative power behind them already. For example, Moderne has already been defending the OpenRewrite trademark on its own and has the financial wherewithal to do that, but I wouldn’t expect the same from Jackson who doesn’t have the same corporate infrastructure (at least I think so). Our needs are perhaps different, and we thought an opt-in structure supported us both in our different situations.\r\n\r\nAs the bootstrapping period has unfolded, it became clear that the foundation is unwilling to fully delegate some administrative functions to projects. In the case of the Trademark policy in particular, the foundation believes it is in fact _necessary_ to force some constraints on the project, a legal opinion we do not share. We can respectfully disagree on the specifics on this point, but maybe the important takeaway is that such a _à la carte_ delegatory confederation as we imagined either isn’t possible or simply isn’t what the foundation wants. And that is OK!\r\n\r\n## Policy development\r\n\r\nThe proposed Trademark policy in particular became a lightning rod for us as early forms of the policy appeared to preclude our team from using the OpenRewrite brand iconography in creative and fun ways that weren't anticipated by the policy. We had been anticipating splitting the icon up into brightly colored assets and using them in physical displays. Something like:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83e6dc29-11c0-4095-b514-4cda928071fc)\r\n\r\nThis kind of fun 3D isomorphic view on the Moderne website also apparently violated the policy:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d51095d-edc5-4584-add0-1fad91f49a31\">\r\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/865d2558-e7da-43d2-83d4-a03d84529352\">\r\n\r\nWe communicated many of these concerns and were repeatedly assured by @ebullient that the _intent_ of the policy was to enforce against potential abusers of the brand not against the developers of the project, and we do believe in the sincerity of Erin's stance. But it continued to be a concern that some future foundation leadership may not feel the same way, and feeling so constrained just... didn't feel right.\r\n\r\nThis conversation, trivial as it might seem, revealed I suppose the larger concern for us as a project.\r\n\r\n## Voting structure\r\n\r\nWith a majoritarian voting structure, policies could realistically be changed at any time, including to be more restrictive, in ways that could be well meaning but cause harm to the company Moderne (and other contributors) which pours so much energy and investment into the project.\r\n\r\nI don't have an obvious solution for this. Clearly any one participating project blocking adoption of policy changes could substantially alter the ability of the foundation to stay relevant under changing circumstances. So perhaps this is best seen as a foreseeable consequence of committee oversight that, at any rate, wasn't apparent until some of these policies began to be circulated.\r\n\r\n## A warm farewell I hope\r\n\r\nI want to once again reaffirm my admiration for the foundation and what it has set out to do, and hope you understand that we acted in good faith to find a path to inclusion. I also hope you’ll appreciate the tremendous pressure we are under as a project whose future is entwined with our livelihoods as well – a project that is in some cases being exploited commercially by larger companies with no return of value to the project. We will continue to work to find our own way in building software together in the open as much as possible.\r\n",
