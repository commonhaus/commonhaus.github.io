It is now time for our founding projects to have a thorough review (for the vendor-backed projects, that probably means a conversation with OSPO and/or other lawyers).\r\n\r\nPay particular attention to bootstrapping/formation agreement if you haven't already.\r\n\r\nNot time for a vote yet, but we're entering phase 2. Feedback welcome through whatever path works, promptness is appreciated."
