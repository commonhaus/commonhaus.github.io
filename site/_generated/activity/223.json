  "content": "### Announcement\r\n\r\nWindermere, Florida - All remote – Jan 13, 2025 – Today, the [Commonhaus Foundation](https://www.commonhaus.org/) is pleased to announce that Infinispan joins as a member project.\r\n\r\n[Infinispan](https://infinispan.org/) is an in-memory cache that can hold nearly any type of data, from plain-text to structured objects. It can be used as a local embedded cache, but can also be scaled to huge clusters and multiple sites. It is polyglot, as you connect to it via multiple protocols, including Hot Rod, REST, Redis and Memcached.\r\n\r\n[Tristan Tarrant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristan-tarrant-650487/), who has been leading Infinispan for the past few years, shares:\r\n\r\n> Since its inception sixteen years ago, Infinispan has never stopped evolving, delivering features and performance, going from bare-metal deployments to fully-managed containerized cloud environments, thanks to our mature operator, from simple key/value access to full-text query and vector search. \r\n> While the in-memory database competitive landscape is quite busy, Infinispan has distinguished itself by always being fully open-source, never putting any so-called “enterprise” functionality behind restrictive licenses.\r\n> Infinispan frequently participates in research projects, and we are never afraid to experiment with new ideas.\r\n> \r\n> The Commonhaus Foundation provides Infinispan with an ideal home to continue to pursue its natural evolution: the Foundation’s transparency, openness and flexibility are the key values (pun intended) that we’ve always embraced and we want to add our own energy behind them.\r\n> \r\n> It also happens to also be the home of a number of amazing key components we collaborate with: Hibernate, Debezium, Jackson and Quarkus. We are lucky to be in their company!\r\n\r\nTristan Tarrant is a Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat. He’s been involved with open source for over 30 years and has contributed to many projects like SANE, GIMP and Wine.\r\n\r\n",
