### Proposal

Reviewing the IP Policy (again), and...

It's one thing to require a DCO. That's pretty typical these days.

CLAs are more complicated. Example language from IP Policy for OpenJSF:

> The technical governing body of each Project may provide for additional requirements with respect to contributions. For example, a Project may require that new code contributions to a Project be accompanied by an OpenJS Foundation CLA, available at https://openjsf.org/cla.

For CF to be able to deal with CLAs, I think we'd have to define one (for the foundation). See the following:

- https://openjsf.org/cla
- https://www.apache.org/licenses/contributor-agreements.html
- https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php

Do we want to start here? Is DCO enough?

At the moment, I'm favoring punting the CLA language, and we can revisit/revise that aspect of the policy when warranted.
