Background: 

> The general feel I started with, as input, is the concept of a (well-built) tree-house. A place where we come together to work on cool things and support each other that is also connected to live and growing things (the tree). This was an image that resonated with folks when I first floated it (I mean, seriously, as a grown-up, I would still go hang out in a tree-house if I could).

> 
> Some of the choices (re: bolder lines) are specifically related to how the image renders at different sizes (see some of the supporting materials).

> For larger sizes, other parts of the page, bolder or softer is absolutely something to think about and consider!
