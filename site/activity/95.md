### Consensus mechanism

<!--vote::manual comments -->
Rank them in order of preference.

- (🚀, optional) Specific number if you have a favorite
- (👎, optional) Specific number if it is an absolute no

Constructive commentary is helpful.

If you have other suggestions, try to put together a full palette to demonstrate.
