Don't let the relative quiet fool you – like a duck serenely gliding on a lake, there's been a flurry of activity happening under the surface!

🌟 Big News: We're on Our Way to Incorporation!

That's right – we're in the process of bringing the Commonhaus Foundation, Inc. to life. It's an exciting phase, and it means we're getting down to the nitty-gritty.

🛠️ Time to Roll Up Our Sleeves

Now's the moment to get serious, especially about our bylaws. I'm looking to collaborate with a small, dedicated group to fine-tune these bylaws before they go for legal review. We're treading into complex territory (just look at the open discussion items, there are good questions in there).
 
📝 Check Out the Latest PR

I've restructured our governance draft such that the contents of the (eventual, final) repository will be the Foundation's bylaws. ~~Take a peek: [PR #33](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation-draft/pull/33)~~ (See comments). I will merge after a few days, and will begin structured reviews after that.

🎉 For a Bit of Fun

I've been working on a draft Hugo website that syncs up with the foundation-draft content.
What's next? It will soon pull blog posts from GitHub Discussion announcements like this one, keeping everything interconnected and up-to-date.

If you want to help with bylaw revision, I would love it if you found me before I find you. 🫣
