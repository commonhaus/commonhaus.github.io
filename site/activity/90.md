### Announcement

https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation-draft/releases/tag/final-draft

That is the batch through legal review by Aaron Williamson at Williamson Legal. It is now time for our founding projects to have a thorough review (for the vendor-backed projects, that probably means a conversation with OSPO and/or other lawyers).

Pay particular attention to bootstrapping/formation agreement if you haven't already.

Not time for a vote yet, but we're entering phase 2. Feedback welcome through whatever path works, promptness is appreciated.
