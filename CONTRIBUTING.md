# Contributing to Commonhaus Foundation Website

We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project! This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing.

## Deno, Lume and Vento

This project uses [Deno](https://deno.land/) as the runtime, the [Lume static site generator](https://lume.land/) and [Vento templating engine](https://vento.js.org/).

## Setup

1. **Checkout this repository and all recursive submodules**

    You can do this by running the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive <https://github.com/commonhaus/commonhaus.github.io.git>
    ```

2. **Install Deno**

   Install it by following the instructions on the [Deno website](https://deno.land/#installation).

3. **Install the GH CLI** (optional)

    Content generation uses the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) for GraphQL queries. If you want to use the tasks that pull new content, you'll need the GH CLI.

4. **Serve the website**

    You can serve the website locally by running the following command:

    ```bash
    deno task serve
    ```

    Other tasks are available (in `deno.json`, list with `deno task`):

    - `build`: Builds the website (first Lume, then Vite+Svelte)
    - **Lume**
        - `attach`: Attaches a debugger to lume.
        - `debug`: Allows you to attach a debugger to a deno task.
        - `serve`: Builds and serves the website, and watch for changes.
    - **Vite** (Svelte-based Membership UI, run after Lume)
        - `vite-build`: use vite to compile svelte files
        - `vite-dev`: use vite to watch and recompile svelte files
    - **Generation** (requires the GH CLI)
        - `about`: Update metadata about members of the foundation based on the CONTACTS list.
        - `activity`: Query the latest discussions and PRs from the foundation repository and update corresponding site pages.
        - `lastmod`: update information about the contents of the foundation submodule.
        - `votes`: Update metadata related to a vote (discussion or PR)
    - **Verification**
        - `checklocal`: test links against a running local server.
        - `checklinks`: check for invalid links

5. **Working on the Membership UI** (requires the [cf-admin-bot](https://github.com/commonhaus/automation))

    The Vite-related task will watch for changes and recompile updated files. This works well with Lume `serve`,
    just make sure to start Lume first.

    ```bash
    # start Lume to watch, (re)build, and serve files in public/
    deno task serve
    # start vite to watch and (re)build public/assets/member.js
    deno task vite-dev
    ```

### Weird things

<img src="./docs/website_2024-04-18_1339.31.excalidraw.light.svg" alt="diagram of data sources/workflow" width="90%"/>

- **Foundation submodule**
    - Content from the [commonhaus/foundation](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation) repository is the canonical source for most site content.
    - `.github/lastmod.ts` updates `site/_generated/foundation.json` with the git-derived metadata for "interesting" files (`.md` and `.yaml`) from that repository
    - Workflows: `.github/workflows/push-content.yml`
- **About pages**
    - `site/foundation/CONTACTS.yaml` and `site/foundation/PROJECTS.yaml` are the authoritative sources for the project list and the about page.
    - `.github/about.ts` queries GitHub for the latest bio / profile pictures for committee members.
    - Data transformation: `.github/about.ts` updates `site/_data/about.yml`, which is used by `site/about/_data.ts` to provide data to `site/about/index.md`
    - Workflows: `.github/workflows/push-content.yml` and `.github/workflows/update-metadata.yml`
- **Foundation pages** (`site/foundation/**`) have to render properly in both the original repository (and in pdfs) and on the website. That means, some weirdness.
    - **Content**
        - `site/_generated/foundation.json` contains git-derived file information
        - `site/_generated/foundation.yml` is hand-tended to specify the pages from the foundation repository that should be included in the website (and to specify the URL they should use and provide a meta description, etc.).
    - **Rendering**
        - `plugins/foundationData.ts` defines html and markdown preprocessors to merge content metadata with lume page definitions
        - `site/_includes/layouts/bylaws.vto` and `site/_includes/layouts/foundation.vto` both assume the content already contains the h1/title (which these pages do).
        - `site/_includes/layouts/bylaws.vto` defines a navigation sidebar for bylaws and policies.
- **Activities** (`activity`) are generated from the content of GH Discussions, Pull Requests, and Issues.
    - `site/_generated/activity/*.json` files are generated from PRs/Issues/Discussions by `.github/activity.ts`
    - `site/activity/index.page.js` turns those json files into pages
    - `./site/_generated/authors.yml` is updated with information about the author of each item.
    - `site/_includes/layouts/activity.vto` uses `site/_includes/layouts/activitySidebar.vto` to define a sidebar for individual activity pages (Announcement vs. Notices)
    - `site/_includes/layouts/activityArchive.vto` defines an archive page listing all activities grouped by date. See `site/activity/announcements.md` and `site/activity/notices.md`
    - `site/_includes/layouts/activityOverview.vto` defines the activity overview page, showing the most recent Announcements, Notices, and Votes. See `site/activity/index.md`.
    - Workflows: `.github/workflows/push-content.yml`
- **Vote result summaries** (`votes`)
    - `site/_generated/votes/**/*.json` files are generated from PRs/Issues/Discussions by `.github/votes.ts`
    - `site/votes/index.page.js` turns those json files into pages and svg assets
    - `site/_includes/layouts/activityVote.vto` uses `site/_includes/layouts/activitySidebar.vto` to define a sidebar for individual activity pages.
    - `site/_includes/layouts/activityVoteArchive.vto` provides an archive page listing all vote results
    - Workflows: `.github/workflows/push-votes.yml`
- **Membership UI** (`member/*`)
    - This is a separate/follow-on build for a single-page application (SPA) built with Svelte. It is built as a secondary step (after Lume). It uses one of the bots as its backend to work with user data (membership application, email alias management, and form-signing).
