# Contributing to Commonhaus Foundation Website

We appreciate your interest in contributing to our project! This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing.

## Legal

This website's content (excluding generated content and content sourced in repositories with other licenses) is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA 4.0). 

All contributions are subject to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). The DCO text is also included verbatim in the [dco.txt](dco.txt) file in the root directory of the repository.

## Deno, Lume and Vento

This project uses [Deno](https://deno.land/) as the runtime, the [Lume static site generator](https://lume.land/) and [Vento templating engine](https://vento.js.org/).

## Setup

1. **Checkout this repository and all recursive submodules**

    You can do this by running the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive <https://github.com/commonhaus/commonhaus.github.io.git>
    ```

2. **Install Deno**

   Install it by following the instructions on the [Deno website](https://deno.land/#installation).

3. **Install the GH CLI** (optional)

    Content generation uses the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) for GraphQL queries. If you want to use the tasks that pull new content, you'll need the GH CLI.

4. **Serve the website**

    You can serve the website locally by running the following command:

    ```bash
    deno task serve
    ```

    Other tasks are available (in `deno.json`, list with `deno task`):

    - `build`: Builds the website (first Lume, then Vite+Svelte)
    - **Lume**
        - `attach`: Allows you to attach a debugger to a deno task.
        - `serve`: Builds and serves the website, and watch for changes. Membership UI requires a backing service (see [cf-admin-bot](https://github.com/commonhaus/automation))
        - `serve-all`: Builds and serves the website, and watch for changes. Provides a mock backend for the Membership UI
    - **Generation** (requires the GH CLI)
        - `about`: Update metadata about members of the foundation based on the CONTACTS list.
        - `activity`: Query the latest discussions and PRs from the foundation repository and update corresponding site pages.
        - `lastmod`: update information about the contents of the foundation submodule.
        - `checkCsp`: Recompute CSP hashes (see the [CSP header in the base layout](site/_includes/layouts/base.vto))

## Content Generation Architecture

The website combines content from multiple sources through several transformation steps, as illustrated in the diagram below:

### Data Flow Components

- **Foundation Submodule**: Content from the [commonhaus/foundation](https://github.com/commonhaus/foundation) repository is the canonical source for most site content
- **About Pages**: Generated from authoritative YAML files combined with GitHub profile data
- **Foundation Pages**: Special handling to ensure content renders properly in multiple contexts
- **Activities**: Generated from GitHub Discussions, PRs, and Issues
- **Vote Summaries**: Generated from voting activity in GitHub repositories
- **Membership UI**: Single-page Svelte application with backend integration
